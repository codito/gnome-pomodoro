## What is the pomodoro technique?

The [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_technique) is a time and focus management method which improves productivity and quality of work. The name comes from a kitchen timer, which can be used to keep track of time. In short, you are supposed to focus on work for around 25 minutes and then have a well deserved break in which you should relax. This cycle repeats once it reaches 4th break – then you should take a longer break (have a walk or something). It's that simple. It improves your focus, physical health and mental agility depending on how you spend your breaks and how strictly you follow the routine.
