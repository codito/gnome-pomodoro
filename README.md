### What is the pomodoro technique?

The [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_technique) is a time and focus management method which improves productivity and quality of work. The name comes from a kitchen timer, which can be used to keep track of time. In short, you are supposed to focus on work for around 25 minutes and then have a well deserved break in which you should do nothing but relax. This cycle repeats once it reaches 4th break – then you should take a longer break (have a walk or something). It's that simple. It improves your focus, physical health and mental agility depending on how you spend your breaks and how strictly you follow the routine.

2. You may need to install tools and dependencies before building it

   **On Ubuntu:**

        sudo apt-get install gnome-common intltool valac libglib2.0-dev gobject-introspection libgirepository1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libgnome-desktop-3-dev libcanberra-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev fonts-droid libsqlite3-dev libgom-dev

   **On Fedora:**

        sudo dnf install gnome-common intltool vala vala-tools glib2-devel gobject-introspection-devel gtk3-devel gnome-desktop3-devel libcanberra-devel dbus-glib-devel gstreamer1-devel google-droid-sans-fonts sqlite-devel gom-devel
   
   **On Gentoo:**
   
        sudo emerge gnome-common intltool vala-common vala gobject-introspection-common gobject-introspection dev-libs/glib dbus-glib dev-libs/gom media-fonts/droid
      
      Then you need to link your vala executables and your pkgconfig:
      
        cd /usr/bin
        sudo ln -s vala-0.26 vala
        sudo ln -s valac-0.26 valac
        sudo ln -s vapigen-0.26 vapigen
        sudo ln -s vapicheck-0.26 vapicheck
        sudo ln -s vala-gen-introspect-0.26 vala-gen-introspect
        sudo ln -s /usr/share/pkgconfig/vapigen-0.26.pc /usr/share/pkgconfig/vapigen.pc

3. Build it and install

        ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --datadir=/usr/share
        make
        sudo make install

4. Close gnome-pomodoro

   If you're updating, you need to close running background service by opening Preferences and clicking Quit it the AppMenu or by ```killall gnome-pomodoro``` in terminal.

5. Launch it

        gnome-pomodoro

   It will enable GNOME Shell extension. A new indicator should show up in the top panel. If it doesn't, restart GNOME Shell by hitting *Alt + F2* and typing *r* in command.


### From extensions.gnome.org

You can install older version via [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/53/pomodoro/).


## Advanced settings

If you want to tinker with more settings, you can use *dconf-editor* or *gsettings*. Lookup */org/gnome/pomodoro* tree.


**Change keyboard shortcut**

As it's not possible to select a shortcut having a [Super key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key), you need to use the commandline:

    gsettings set org.gnome.pomodoro.preferences toggle-timer-key "['<Super>p']"


**Reset settings to default**

If you ever need to bring the app to original settings or state, you can do it by:

    gsettings reset-recursively org.gnome.pomodoro

For more options see *gsettings --help*


## Debugging

If you experience extension causing problems, run *gnome-shell* like this:

    DISPLAY=:0 gnome-shell --replace > gnome-shell.log 2>&1

and send us *gnome-shell.log* file. A a side note, you can recover from most *gnome-shell* crashes using that command.
